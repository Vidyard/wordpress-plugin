# Vidyard Wordpress Plugin

Adds oEmbed support for Vidyard players to Wordpress.

Will automatically convert the following Vidyard URLs into a video when editing a Wordpress site:
- `http(s)://embed.vidyard.com/share/PLAYER_UUID`
- `http(s)://share.vidyard.com/watch/PLAYER_UUID`
- `http(s)://play.vidyard.com/PLAYER_UUID`
- `http(s)://*.hubs.vidyard.com/watch/PLAYER_UUID`

To give the player a specific width or height, enclose the URL in an `[embed]` tag:

`[embed width="123" height="456"]https://embed.vidyard.com/share/PLAYER_UUID[/embed]`

___
